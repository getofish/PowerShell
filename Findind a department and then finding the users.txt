Query a list in AD using PowerShell.
Open up Powershell.
Type in the following

Get-ADGroup –filter * | sort name| select name
This will querry all groups inside of an AD environment.
Go one step further by using the –Identity modifier. This will allow you to look up a particular grop
Get-ADGroup –filter * | sort name| select name –Identity “Insert groupname”
In this example I was looking up XXXXXXXXXXXXX
It would look like this
Get-ADGroup –filter * | sort name| select name –Identity “XXXXXXXXXXX”
This will show you all group members in this group as well as domain ID. You can add a select name to the end of the string to only have the names of the users
Get-ADGroup –filter * | sort name| select name –Identity “XXXXXXXXX” | Select name

Pipe that information out. Piping is a wonderful tool. It allows you to send all that info to a an excel sheet
Get-ADGroup –filter * | sort name| select name –Identity “XXXXXXXX” | Export-csv -path C:\XXXXXXXXX.csv –NoTypeInformation

By doing this I am telling the process to pipe the info out and make it clean.
